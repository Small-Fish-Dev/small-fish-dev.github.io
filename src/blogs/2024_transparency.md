**Happy New Year, everyone!**

We wouldn't be where we are without our community.
In keeping with our commitment to transparency, we think it's only right to set a good example and take a scrupulous look back at the year. (Not in chronological order)


<Heading title="Socks" />

Yes, the legends are true, we have our own line of merch which will never see the light of day: Small Fish branded socks.

Made with <b>100% organic cotton</b>, knitted design, and biocompostable packaging, they were shipped exclusively to Small Fish members and close associates.

Sorry, we are not selling these socks, we consider them to be a test run, perhaps in the future.

Some believe we bribed Facepunch to win the second game jam by shipping them a box, but we reached out to garry about it after the results were already out, and if that was the intention it clearly didn't work!

<Heading h="h3" title="How was it done?" />
The entire thing has been in the works for half a year, but the designing and manufacturing process took about a month and half.

We first did our research on sock technology, locking in with half-terry cotton knitted socks, where they use tinted threads to weave the design itself.

We then reached out to companies for quotes, who then sent us the pattern files. We brainstormed a few designs and hired a couple of artists on Fiverr to turn them into reality, we really enjoyed the wave pattern Grodbert came up with, and after a few revisions we had our design.

After sending the files over, it took just a few days to get them produced, and two weeks to arrive. We immediately started shipping to our members, unfortunately we had no way for the Russian members to receive them.

<Heading h="h3" title="How much did it cost?" />
The designing process was roughly <b>$120.00</b>.

We bought 100 socks for around $8.40 each, or <b>$840.00</b>; we could've gotten a better price if we ordered more, but that didn't sound like a good investment.

Shipping to our members depended on the location, but it hovered from $4.00 to $18.00, I'd say <b>$80.00</b>.

In total we spent about **$1,040.00** on socks, and with "we" I mean me, ubre, I'd never let any member pay for expenses like these.

I'd say it was worth it, but it was scary at the time to do just for a meme! Plus I started including pvc stickers in the packages as an extra, I print them at home and cut them by hand!

<Heading title="Transparency" />
In 2024 we implemented the following measures:

- Opened a commit log for every major repository;
- Made the Discord server's audit log public;
- <b>Fish of the day</b> role, which is able to view every developer channel and archive. This forces us to self-moderate and avoid circlejerk behaviour;
- Released many open source projects, such as our in-house player controller and the entirety of "My Summer Cottage", amongst others.

<Heading title="Community Council" />
Earlier this year, Facepunch set up a Community Council within the S&box Discord server.
The council's purpose is to sift through messages, catch any unreported bugs, and bring attention to important issues inside of the <b>#council</b> channel.

I was elected the "Community President", I brought a few users based on how many issues they opened and how active they were on the server, the first being DoctorGurke from Eagle One.

From there on we would hold votes to add other users, mainly looking for people that could represent their organization/community or had a set of skills that others didn't.

<Heading h="h3" title="The changes" />

The day I became president, I set up a [public spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XIGav1NendUxty2mKRX4axeObF0_6CEK3-rDgqjocsc/) to keep track of issues based on how important and popular we felt they were. I bet it's annoying for Facepunch developers to look at it every day, so we mostly just post the issues directly in the channel and the spreadsheet is there to let people know the developers are aware of the issues.

Sometimes Facepunch asks us opinions on upcoming changes or events, most recently with [the Tech Jam](https://sbox.game/c/tech1), which we asked for more artist friendly categories.

I then set up a timer to exactly 6 months until the next presidential vote, in <b>January 21st</b>.

We're planning on making a small game hosted on s&box where each user can vote for their president on the week of the elections, this would be hosted by Small Fish but I'll try to make it as open and trasparent as possible.

The elections for a new community president is something I made up, I'm not even sure Facepunch will recognize a winner but I'm hoping they do, just as I hope every consecutive president will maintain this tradition.

Of course, I think I have good chances at winning, but if I don't I'll pass everything to the new president and enjoy my stress-free life with permanent secret service protection.


<Heading title="Subreddit" />
I managed to become the owner of the <b>r/sandbox</b> subreddit with the help of the Reddit admins, afterwards I added everybody in the council that wanted to help as moderators, and garry accepted too which I found funny.

We revamped the subreddit, started actively posting anything s&box related, set up resources, and included a list to [all known S&box discord servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/sandbox/comments/18mzljc/sbox_communities_and_development_organizations/) to help them with visibility. 

Truth be told, I also nabbed other abandoned s&box subreddits, all they'd have is people asking for keys and pushed outdated info on search engines, which I though was harming s&box's reputation, so I closed them and redirected to the "official" one.

If anybody wants to become the new owner of these subreddits, I'll gladly hand them over as long as they promise to build them up.

The second biggest s&box subreddit is owned by the r/gmod owners: [r/playsandbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/playsandbox/).
It doesn't see more than a couple of posts every year, so I assumed it was abandoned as well only to find out the moderators were still active, so at least I don't hold a monopoly.

Here's the subreddit stats, I'd like to say I made an impact but it's clear the spikes happen whenever s&box has a big update or goes public.
