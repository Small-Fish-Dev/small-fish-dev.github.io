**Happy New Year, everyone!**

We wouldn't be where we are without our community.
In keeping with our commitment to transparency, we think it's only right to set a good example and take a scrupulous look back at the year. (Not in chronological order)


<Heading title="Socks" />

Yes, the legends are true, we have our own line of merch which will never see the light of day: Small Fish branded socks.

Made with <b>100% organic cotton</b>, knitted design, and biocompostable packaging, they were shipped exclusively to Small Fish members and close associates.

Sorry, we are not selling these socks, we consider them to be a test run, perhaps in the future.

Some believe we bribed Facepunch to win the second game jam by shipping them a box, but we reached out to garry about it after the results were already out, and if that was the intention it clearly didn't work!

<Heading h="h3" title="How was it done?" />
The entire thing has been in the works for half a year, but the designing and manufacturing process took about a month and half.

We first did our research on sock technology, locking in with half-terry cotton knitted socks, where they use tinted threads to weave the design itself.

We then reached out to companies for quotes, who then sent us the pattern files. We brainstormed a few designs and hired a couple of artists on Fiverr to turn them into reality, we really enjoyed the wave pattern Grodbert came up with, and after a few revisions we had our design.

After sending the files over, it took just a few days to get them produced, and two weeks to arrive. We immediately started shipping to our members, unfortunately we had no way for the Russian members to receive them.

<Heading h="h3" title="How much did it cost?" />
The designing process was roughly <b>$120.00</b>.

We bought 100 socks for around $8.40 each, or <b>$840.00</b>; we could've gotten a better price if we ordered more, but that didn't sound like a good investment.

Shipping to our members depended on the location, but it hovered from $4.00 to $18.00, I'd say <b>$80.00</b>.

In total we spent about **$1,040.00** on socks, and with "we" I mean me, ubre, I'd never let any member pay for expenses like these.

I'd say it was worth it, but it was scary at the time to do just for a meme! Plus I started including pvc stickers in the packages as an extra, I print them at home and cut them by hand!

<Heading title="Transparency" />

In 2024 we implemented the following measures:

- Opened a commit log for every major repository;
- Made the Discord server's audit log public;
- <b>Fish of the day</b> role, which is able to view every developer channel and archive. This forces us to self-moderate and avoid circlejerk behaviour;
- Released many open source projects, such as our in-house player controller and the entirety of "My Summer Cottage", amongst others.
